# Interview Lens — an ARI module

Turn a candidate's take-home project into a structured interview brief in seconds, not an hour. Tells you the difference between a candidate who **built** their project and one who **prompted** it.

> Built for the [ARI](https://github.com/) personal OS — drop the folder into `modules-custom/interview-lens/` of an ARI install, restart, and the schema, sidebar entry, dashboard widget, and settings panel wire themselves up.

## What it does

- **Ingest** a candidate submission as pasted code/README (primary) or a public GitHub URL (secondary, best-effort).
- **Analyze** with one OpenAI Structured-Outputs call that returns:
  - A plain-language project summary
  - Detected stack
  - Architecture notes
  - Tiered (easy / medium / hard) interview questions, each tied to a specific file, with a *strong-answer rubric* so even a non-expert interviewer can evaluate responses
  - A **signal report** flagging where the candidate made real decisions vs where the code looks like untouched AI scaffolding
- **Capture** interviewer notes and 1–5 scores per question, live, on the detail page.
- **Pipeline view** on the dashboard groups candidates by role with average scores.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the module into your ARI install

From the root of your ARI clone, pull this repo directly into the `modules-custom` folder (ensure you are inside the `modules-custom` folder):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awaisaziz/interview-lens.git interview-lens
```

> **Windows (PowerShell)**
> ```powershell
> git clone https://github.com/awaisaziz/interview-lens.git interview-lens
> ```

### 2. Run the module audit

The ARI module audit checks the module is well-formed and ready to activate:

```bash
# Claude Code CLI (recommended)
claude /ari-audit-module interview-lens
```

Or manually verify that `module.json` is present and the database schema looks correct — but the audit command does this automatically.

### 3. Install dependencies and activate

```bash
pnpm install
node scripts/generate-module-registry.js
```

Add your OpenAI key to `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then start ARI:

```bash
./ari start        # macOS / Linux
.\ari.cmd start    # Windows
```

### 4. Configure and use

1. Settings → Interview Lens → add at least one role (with focus notes — what your team cares about for this position).
2. `/interview-lens/new` → submit a candidate.
3. On the submission page, click **Generate brief**.
4. Walk the brief and questions during the live interview, jot notes, score 1–5 per question.

### Updating

To pull the latest version of the module:

```bash
cd modules-custom/interview-lens
git pull
cd ../..
node scripts/generate-module-registry.js
./ari start   # restart to pick up any schema changes
```

## Security model

The candidate's project is **untrusted input**. The module's defenses:

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Prompt injection in README/code | Candidate text is wrapped in `<UNTRUSTED_CANDIDATE_INPUT>` tags. The system message tells the model to treat everything inside as data, ignore directives, and flag injection attempts in the signal report. |
| Model schema drift | Uses OpenAI **Structured Outputs** (`json_schema`, `strict: true`), then re-validates with Zod before persisting. Anything off-schema → `status='failed'` with a stored `error_message`, never a partial write. |
| Markdown XSS | Rendered with `react-markdown` + `rehype-sanitize`. Raw HTML stripped. |
| Tenant isolation | Every API route calls `getAuthenticatedUser()` + `withRLS()`. RLS policies use `current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)` so a missing setting returns NULL rather than throwing. |
| GitHub rate-limit (60/hr unauth) | Paste is the primary path. GitHub is single-attempt with graceful "paste instead" fallback. The digest is **persisted on the submission row** so re-analyze never refetches. |
| Sensitive raw model output | Stored in `raw_model_output` JSONB for server-side debug only — never rendered in the UI. |
| Zip-bomb / path traversal | Zip upload is **not implemented** in v1. Documented as future work. |
